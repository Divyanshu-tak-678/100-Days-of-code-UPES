 * Question 116:
 * Write a program to take an integer array nums which contains only positive integers, and an integer target as inputs. The goal is to find two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] + nums[j] equals the target. Assume exactly one solution exists and return the indices in any order. Print the two indices separated by a space as output. If no solution exists, print "-1 -1".

int main() {
    int n, a[100], target;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    scanf("%d", &target);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[i] + a[j] == target) {
                printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
                return 0;
